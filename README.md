## Judging Criteria

### Design
Our team built a web app that allows users to visualize water consumption over 
the last six months as well as provides tools to predict how much water can be 
saved if they switch to more efficient water appliances.

### Completeness / Polish
We not only delivered on our minimum viable product that accomplishes our design 
goals, but also provides a platform to build additional features as well as several
key API points for other developers to scrape data from our converted database.

### Solve a Problem Statement
Water/Energy Home Use: One of the larger problems our team noticed in today's 
challenge was the lack of tools to visualize all of the data provided to us, both
internally and externally for institutional and consumer use. We wanted to build 
an app that may not solve the entire problem, but rather get the ball rolling for 
other teams to build on top of our platform. Consumer facing teams may want to add 
to our dynamic client side data visualization utilizing Backbone.js and D3. Big data
hunters may be more interested in accessing some of our API endpoints that allows 
easy access to our converted database.

### Is it a solution Utilities or Government can use?
Absolutely. As the government decides to collect more data, our relational database 
is prime for back end developers to rewrite assocations and relations that will
help connect the dots between users, consumption, geolocation, etc. 

### Does it use the Cal Am Data?
While the data provided was a great start, our team felt it could be much more 
useful with consumption breakdown data. Using the EPA estimates for household water
consumption breakdown**, we were able to extrapolate seed data that helped us visualize
how much water we could be saving if we switched to high efficiency water appliances. 
Because of this, our platform is also ready when CAM and the EPA start collecting more data.
